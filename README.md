Title: Game Development Project

Authors: Yahya Faraz and Asad Ali Lodhi

Introduction:

This is Yahya Faraz and Asad Ali Lodhi, and we are proposing a project for our OOP course that involves creating a game in Unity and incorporates key C++ concepts such as pointers, classes, structures, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism. This project will not only help us learn Unity game development but also reinforce our understanding of fundamental C++ principles.

Project Overview:

Our project aims to create a 2D game using the Unity game engine. The game will utilize various C++ concepts to enhance gameplay, such as utilizing pointers for efficient memory management, implementing classes and structures for organizing game data, constructors for object initialization, inheritance for creating game objects with shared attributes, and polymorphism for dynamic behavior. We will also explore the integration of images and audio assets into the project.

Project Breakdown:

To ensure the successful completion of the project, we will divide it into the following milestones:

Concept and Design: Define the game's concept, create a storyboard, and design game characters and assets.
C++ Implementation: Develop the game logic using C++ concepts, including classes, structures, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Unity Integration: Learn how to use Unity and integrate the C++ code with the Unity game engine. Import and assign images and audio assets.
Gameplay Testing: Test the game for functionality and identify any bugs or issues.
Polishing and Final Testing: Refine the game, fix any remaining issues, and conduct final testing to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

Milestones:

The project timeline is as follows:
Milestones:

Gameplay Testing 
Polishing and Final Testing
Challenges and Resolution:

We anticipate several challenges throughout the project, including:

Learning Unity: As beginners in Unity, we may face challenges in understanding the engine's features and capabilities. We will address this by dedicating time to learn Unity through online resources, tutorials, and documentation.

C++ Integration: Integrating C++ code with Unity may require effort, especially when dealing with pointers and polymorphism. We plan to seek guidance from instructors and experienced developers in resolving these issues.

Asset Management: Handling images and audio assets in Unity can be complex. We will learn best practices for asset organization and management to ensure efficient integration.

In conclusion, our project aims to combine C++ principles with Unity game development to create an engaging 2D game. We have outlined milestones and a project timeline, and we are prepared to tackle the anticipated challenges effectively.
